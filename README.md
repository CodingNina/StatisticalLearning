# Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning applied to Titanic case
The aim of this project is about estimating whether Titanic passengers would survive based on demographic, socioeconomic, and familial characteristics and showing how using different predictive models and having PCA, improves the performance. 

# About the dataset
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle, from GettingStarted Prediction Competition. The data is made of three main files: training set (train.csv) and test set (test.csv). 

The dataset includes information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class and so on. The file train.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891) and tells you if they survived or not ("ground truth"). While the file test.csv contains similar information, without the ground truth, which we will predict.

# About ML algorithms
The first part of the project is focused on analysis to have an overview of the different characteristics and how they could affect the passenger survivability, as well as the creation of predictive models to forecast survivals, from the Titanic, using the following learning techniques: 

* Decision tree
* Random Forest
* ANN

The second part is focused on PCA techinques implemented to reduce the complexity of the model and to allow ANN, a better performance, as well as confusion matrices and ROC curves.
